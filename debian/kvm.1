.SH NAME
kvm \- kvm-enabling wrapper for qemu-system-x86_64
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B kvm
wrapper script is used to provide compatibility with old
qemu\-kvm package which has been merged into qemu as of
version 1.3.
.P
The script executes
.RS
.B qemu\-system\-x86_64 \-enable\-kvm
.RE
passing all other command-line arguments to the qemu binary.
This is not the same as old kvm binary, which was using
less strict construct, similar to
.RS
.B qemu\-system\-x86_64 \-machine accel=kvm:tcg
.RE
New wrapper ensures that kvm mode is enabled, or the VM
will not start, while old code falled back to emulation
(tcg) mode if kvm isn't available.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR qemu (1).
